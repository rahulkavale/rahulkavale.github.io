## Rahul Kavale
**Lead Software Engineer | Distributed Systems | LLM & AI Engineering**

With over 12 years of experience in Software engineering, I specialize in building high-performance, distributed systems that scale seamlessly. I architect and implement solutions that process hundreds of requests per second with optimized latency and fault tolerance.

### What I Do

My expertise spans across:

- **Idea to implementation**: I have built multiple systems right from idea to production
- **Distributed Systems Engineering**: Designing scalable architectures handling 500+ RPS with 99.98% uptime
- **AI/LLM Integration**: Building conversational AI frameworks with sophisticated guardrails and safety protocols
- **Stream Processing**: Implementing event-driven architectures for high-throughput data processing

### Technical Skills

My toolkit includes Python, Java, Go, TypeScript, and expertise in database technologies like PostgreSQL, MongoDB, Redis, and DynamoDB. I'm proficient with frameworks such as FastAPI, Spring, Kubernetes, and have extensive experience with event processing systems like Kafka and RabbitMQ.

### Recent Projects

- **PriceGPT**: An LLM-powered recommendation engine that featured on Product Hunt
- **Unsurvey**: A distributed, real-time voice-call system supporting 100K+ concurrent sessions
- **Corrily Pricing Engine**: A high-throughput pricing computation platform with 100ms P95 latency

### Open Source Contributions

I'm passionate about giving back to the developer community through open-source projects:
- **Akar**: A high-performance pattern-matching library for Clojure
- **Spring-raml plugin**: A Maven plugin for integrating RAML API specifications with Spring
